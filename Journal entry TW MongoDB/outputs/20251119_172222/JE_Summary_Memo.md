# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Audit File
**FROM:** Journal Entry Sampling & Testwork Agent
**DATE:** November 19, 2025
**RE:** Journal Entry Population Analysis and Sample Selection

---

## Executive Summary

This memo summarizes the journal entry population analysis and sample selection procedures performed for the current audit period.

## Scope and Approach

We analyzed the general ledger data to identify journal entries and applied risk-based sampling procedures to select items for detailed testing. Our approach included:

1. **Population Building:** Identified 223 journal entries from the general ledger
2. **Risk Assessment:** Applied automated risk heuristics to flag high-risk entries
3. **Sample Selection:** Selected 149 entries using risk-based and random selection methods

## Population Analysis

**Period Covered:** 2024-01-31 to 2024-12-31
**Total Journal Entries:** 223
**Total Net Amount:** $0.00

### Risk Classification:
- **Medium Risk:** 103 entries
- **High Risk:** 90 entries
- **Low Risk:** 30 entries


## Sample Selection Results

**Total Samples Selected:** 149
**Selection Approach:** Risk-based with random supplemental selection

All high-risk and critical entries were selected for testing, with additional random samples to achieve appropriate coverage of the population.

## Status and Next Steps

**Current Status:** Sample selection complete, testing procedures ready to begin

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Request supporting documentation from client (PBC list generated)
2. Perform attribute testing on selected samples
3. Document any exceptions or findings
4. Prepare adjusting journal entries as needed
