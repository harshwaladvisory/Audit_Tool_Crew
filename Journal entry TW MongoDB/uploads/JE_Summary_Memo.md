**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Audit File
**FROM:** [Your Name/Audit Team]
**DATE:** 2024-10-27
**SUBJECT:** Summary of Journal Entry Sampling and Testing - Planning and Selection Phase

This memo summarizes the scope, approach, and factual findings related to the sampling and selection of journal entries for audit testing, covering the period from January 31, 2024, to December 31, 2024.

**1. Scope and Approach**

The scope of this audit work focused on the population of journal entries recorded within the General Ledger for the period spanning January 31, 2024, to December 31, 2024.

The total population comprised 2,325 journal entries. These entries were categorized by risk as follows:
*   Medium Risk: 1,197 entries
*   High Risk: 858 entries
*   Low Risk: 270 entries

For testing purposes, a specific sampling approach was adopted to focus on higher-risk areas. A sample size of 858 entries was selected. The selection method involved choosing all entries classified as 'High Risk', which resulted in the entire high-risk population being included in the sample.

**2. Factual Findings - Sampling and Population Data**

Based on the data extracted for the audit period (2024-01-31 to 2024-12-31), the following factual information has been documented:

*   **Total Population of Journal Entries:** 2,325
*   **Distribution by Risk Category:**
    *   Medium Risk: 1,197 entries
    *   High Risk: 858 entries
    *   Low Risk: 270 entries
*   **Sample Size Selected:** 858 entries
*   **Sample Composition:** The selected sample exclusively comprises all 858 entries classified as High Risk.
*   **Monetary Attributes of Population:**
    *   Total Amount: $0.00
    *   Average Entry Amount: $0.00
    *   Largest Single Entry Amount: $795,115.52

**3. Detailed Testing Results Pending**

This memo documents the planning and selection phase of the journal entry testing. Detailed audit testing procedures on the selected sample of 858 high-risk entries are currently underway. The results, analysis, and conclusions derived from these detailed testing procedures will be documented in a subsequent memo or working papers upon completion.

This concludes the summary of the journal entry sampling and selection phase.
